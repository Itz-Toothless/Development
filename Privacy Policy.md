By using the bot, you automatically accept not only the Terms of Service, but also the privacy terms

**`1. Which data is stored?`**

The Dev-Bot ensures the following:

Server IDs for e.g. logs or the warning system.

User IDs, for example for bot exclusion and acceptance of the ToS, as well as for muted people.

**`2. Who has access to this data?`**

All data is managed by the Bot Developers Ohnezahn DNC#8135, Julius#1755 and Creative Dreamer#0001.

**`3. Who have access to warnings / mutes?`**

Server moderators in which a user was muted / warned.

**`4. How do I get rid of the data?`**

Quite simple, one of the server moderators have to kick the bot out of the server.

**`5. Why does he back up this data at all?`**

On the one hand, the bot would only be partially usable / individually adjustable, for example regarding to server logs.

In addition, it also saves the user ID for warnings or mutes because the bot has to find the user in the database, for example for further warnings or to direct message the person.

On the other hand, it saves the data for the blacklist because the team wants to prevent rule breakers from exploiting the bot.

**`6. I would like this data to be deleted, where can I request it to be deleted?`**

Come to the [Support Server](https://discord.gg/VqAuHFUjTy), you are welcome to discuss the rest of this with Julius # 1755, Creative Dreamer # 0001 and Ohnezahn DNC # 8135.
